# Welcome to My Portfolio

As a student at Olin College of Engineering, I have been contributed to numerous projects. The following project are example of my work as a software engineering so far. Of the projects included below, some are personal projects others are for class work and a few are for a working position.

## Quarter Quizzes

### Description:
 Quarter Quizzes is Web Platform for Boosting High School Student's Test Scores 
 
After graduating from Centre High School, I wanted to find a way to give back to the school. I combined my knowledge of standarized testing to my web development skills to make an online quiz platform. The program had students create accounts and work through a series of quizzes (50 in total). The quizzes were based on the ACT's mathmaics test patterns. Currently the program is in beta testing at Centre High Shchool. Figure A is an image of an example homescreen.

## Facial Recognition

This project used linear algebra to create, test, analyze, and revise a facial recognition software program. We trained an algorithm on a set uniform images and tested it on random images Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then we tested all available images to determine an accuracy and efficiency measure. Overall, we found that a voting system among a combination of derivative and eigenface algorithms results in little efficiency. We also found that using the largest variance of the derivative of an image (change in pixels), results in a lower accuracy than the unprocessed image.
