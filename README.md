## Quarter Quizzes: A Web Platform for Boosting High School Student's Test Scores 

### Description:
 
After graduating from Centre High School, I wanted to find a way to give back to the school. I combined my knowledge of standarized testing to my web development skills to make an online quiz platform. The program had students create accounts and work through a series of quizzes (50 in total). The quizzes were based on the ACT's mathmaics test patterns. Currently the program is in beta testing at Centre High Shchool. Figure A is an image of an example homescreen.
