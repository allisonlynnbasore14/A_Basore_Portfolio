# Welcome to My Portfolio

As a student at Olin College of Engineering, I have been contributed to numerous projects. The following project are example of my work as a software engineering so far. Of the projects included below, some are personal projects others are for class work and a few are for a working position.

# Projects

## Quarter Quizzes

### Description:
 Quarter Quizzes is Web Platform for Boosting High School Student's Test Scores 
 
After graduating from Centre High School, I wanted to find a way to give back to the school. I combined my knowledge of standarized testing to my web development skills to make an online quiz platform. The program had students create accounts and work through a series of quizzes (50 in total). The quizzes were based on the ACT's mathmaics test patterns. Currently the program is in beta testing at Centre High Shchool. Figure A is an image of an example homescreen.

## Manny the Man

As part of principles of engineering, we built a sculpture that mimics a userâ€™s motion. Here is the link to our project website:  http://poe.olin.edu/2017/mannytheman/

## Facial Recognition

This project used linear algebra to create, test, analyze, and revise a facial recognition software program. We trained an algorithm on a set uniform images and tested it on random images Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then we tested all available images to determine an accuracy and efficiency measure. Overall, we found that a voting system among a combination of derivative and eigenface algorithms results in little efficiency. We also found that using the largest variance of the derivative of an image (change in pixels), results in a lower accuracy than the unprocessed image.

## Computer Generated Music
This project used Markov Chain analysis to create computer generated music based off an inputed song. We also incoperated music theory to create a better melody. This project was writted in Python. The following is a link to our website that descripes the project.

## Parlinet

During the summer of 2017, I worked at a start-up called Parlinet. Parlinet was created as a platform that would allow citizens to connect with local politicans with online conversation and suggestions.


## Boat Modeling
This project was to use physics and calculus principals to create a boat design. We then used Mathmatica, Solidworks, and a laser cutter to model and fabricate our boat. We tested our boat for flatness (to have the deck parallel to water), if it could float with a weight load, and for its angle of vanishing stability (AVS) to be between 120 and 140 degrees. Our report is arranged to follow our process used to create this boat. This report will go over general terminology and design considerations such as calculations for center of mass (COM), center of buoyancy (COB), and our calculated AVS with graphical representation. It will also describe the boat performance. The last section will present our redesign suggestions which are imperative for the further success of boats like ours.
